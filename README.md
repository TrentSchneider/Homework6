# WeatherDashboard

## Description
This is a site demonstrating my abilities with APIs and ajax calls. The site is a weather dashboard that allows the user to get the current and 5 day weather for their current location and search for additional locations to get their current and 5 day weather. The site will also shift from day mode to night mode based off the current time of the displayed city compared to the location's sunrise and sunset times.

## Installation
There is no installation needed as this will work with any browser.

## Usage
On initial site load, the user's browser will prompt them about sharing their location. If they agree, they will be given the current weather and 5 day weather for their current location and have the option to search for additional locations. If they don't they will be presented with a blank template for current and 5 day weather and will have the option to search for additional locations. When the user searches for an aditional location, that locations current and 5 day weather will be presented and the searched location will be added to the top of the list below the search field so that it can be selected again later. If the user searches for multiple locations and selects one of the previous locations, that location will have it's current and 5 day weather presented and that location will move to the top of the list. The site will also shift from day mode to night mode based off the current time of the displayed city compared to the location's sunrise and sunset times.
